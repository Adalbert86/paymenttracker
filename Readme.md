I have spent one day coding up this project, I skipped the bonus question due to lack of time as my work schedule won't allow more time for this. I have used basic common Java libraries. Project is wrapped in Maven package. 

You need to have Java JDK installed in order to build and run.

Install & run steps:

1) Clone it into your folder
2) Build it using "mvn clean compile assembly:single"
3) Run it using "java -jar target/paymenttracker-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar sampleInput.txt" 

You should be able to see the tests being executed sucessfully. Program takes up to 1 argument which is a filename.
Included is one bash script for a quick run (see run.sh).
